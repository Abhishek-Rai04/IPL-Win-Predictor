# IPL-Win-Predictor
This project is a machine learning-based application that predicts the winning probability of an IPL (Indian Premier League) match in real time. Built with Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and Streamlit, the predictor takes match conditions as input (teams, runs left, balls remaining, wickets, etc.) and outputs the likelihood of a team winning.
